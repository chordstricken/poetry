# The Old Jazz Man

```
There is a man in the street
who plays Jazz Guitar.
Though he remains unnamed, he is known.
His tunes are consistent and practiced,
scaling up and down
along frets
like a blind dog trapped in
a maze
searching, feeling, searching
but never finding
what has long been lost.
```
