# In Anger
```
I am on edge.
Not on "the" edge, just
on edge.
Chaos causes that from time to time.
So does fear.
The kind 
        which twists
    the brain
and causes you to scream, "WHY?!"
    (but internally, and with italics.)

Instead of actually screaming,
risking ripples on my calm, peaceful surface,
I just remember, deliberately, that
turmoil is very much a relative thing.
It changes by the person.

Emotions pass over me
and through me
when I remember this.
