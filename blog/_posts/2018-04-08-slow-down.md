# Slow Down

```
Don't forget to slow down.
The world will fire you forward into disaster.
Even the hardest object will shatter
if it is traveling fast enough.
Slow down.
Be still, and observe. See
the soft dust granules float through the air.
Smell the earth around you; nitrogen, oxygen, carbon
and the lack of it.
Taste your breath, your life, your being.
Listen not to the silence, but the life
which breaks it.
```
