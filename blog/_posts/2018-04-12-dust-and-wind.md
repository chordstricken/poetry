# Dust and Wind

```
Dust drifts through the city
as if coughed, or spat from the Desert;
the furiosa of the wasteland.

What an absurd thought; the desert
as a wasteland.
How arrogant, to think something wasteful
because it is uninhabitable by humans.
Arctic wasteland.
Pacific wastewaters.
Nordic wasteskies.
Absurdity.

It is a utopia
while it is free.
