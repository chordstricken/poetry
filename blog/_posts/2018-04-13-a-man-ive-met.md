# A Man I've Met

```
The man named Frank is afraid
of himself
He is confined by his lack of words.
THe man named Frank is a quiet man.
Few words are enough; less is often more
yadda.
But he is trapped in silence, more than not,
because a fear not called fear binds him.
He doubts his thoughts are unique.
He assumes what is unspoken exists.
He hates what the world has defined as awkward.
So he becomes a man who never gives words;
never simply says
"I love you."
