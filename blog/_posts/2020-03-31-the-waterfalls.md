# The Waterfalls

```
I see ghosts dance between the mountainsides.
There, then not.
The sky moans and throws tantrums while
I watch.
There, then not.
I go to the tropics to escape chaos
by embracing it.
There, then not.
My heart feels this heaviness
like a sudden tropical waterfall
disappearing behind hidden doors
and showing up again;
inconsistently consistent.
