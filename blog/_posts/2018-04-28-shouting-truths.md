# Shouting Truths

```
There are people shouting outside.
Shouting is a tool used for
self-exploration:

Scream what you think might be true,
and measure reactions.

There are people shouting outside.
I question their truths. I test them.
I wear them like masks and
see how they fit.
Truth is an awkward thing;
so corruptible by our own faces.
At this point, I don't know
what fits and
what is just noise.
