# Davisson and Germer

```
The double slit experiment unlocked my universe.
I believe in the river of time forking
like an infinite delta, parallel paths
dancing on the choices of chaos.
I believe dimensions are infinite;
mathematical dimensions.
For every astronomical entity,
there is something bigger or smaller to measure it by.
We are both falling and soaring
through time and space
without end.
This is the most beautiful existence.
For every falling follicle, a planet dances a new path.
Take heart, because every regret you have
is lived out differently 
by you 
in another path.
You are all, and all is you.
By simply thinking, you create, and destroy.
You are all, and all is you.
We are all, and all is us.
