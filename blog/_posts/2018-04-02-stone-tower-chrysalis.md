# Stone Tower Chrysalis
```
I watch workers scatter
the lot; granules of fertilizer intrinsically sprawling
I watch from my apartment,
aloof, omniscient.
They are building a chrysalis 30 stories high
which will hatch thousands of young futures and mark
its name in the stone of the New Age of Phoenix.
