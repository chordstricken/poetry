# Through the Body of the Shaped Glass Figure

```
The shaped glass figure is fragile.
Stray  words   cause    cracks     like      dry       sand.
The intention of the observer
can  m e l t  it, if conditions are too wrong.

The shaped glass figure is fragile,
but the observer can see a new world
            twisted
    turned
        colored
refracted 
 through 
  the
   body
    of
     the
      glass
       figure.
Not distorted
    (for that word is too personal)
Not beautiful
    (for that word is too often construed)
Not changed
    (for it is the same world seen)

It is undefined.
