# The Dove

```
Be the diving dove next time you fall
Under love or hate can serenity uncask
Into the frame of Ka, the endless well
Which layer of your mind shall you unmask?
For heart and mind and spirit tread
Together, as one, from the same source
The core of our being but a single thread
Running through the pattern of life's course
Causing pools to whirl as we step to source
Divinity is stopping to check and consider
No supreme being exists to exert its force
So unto your world be a kindness emitter.
    Be the diving dove next time you fall.
    Be the thriving love next time I call.
```
