# Empathetic Eyes

```
When I was younger, I couldn't see your truth.
The world was centered on me. But
then I started peering 
into other peoples' eyes.

You can seem them better that way.

It's odd, though.
I can't consciously think when locked with someone.
The exchange is too absolute to allow that, I think.
There is only the feeling of the connection.
The empathy.

I still struggle with myself.
I avoid eyes.
They are so intrusive and I am so private.

But I still find that a little bit of courage
opens up many windows.
