# Drunk Face

```
Your face lights up when you drink.
Your arms flail about when you talk
like you are falling, trying to grab
anything.
Every liquor-breath holds a hundred words
while you try to figure out the world
and yourself.
I'm terrified of you when you drink.
I'm terrified of why you drink
because I know it means you can't
just let go.

But you have to let go.
Please.
If you continue,
you will destroy yourself.
```
