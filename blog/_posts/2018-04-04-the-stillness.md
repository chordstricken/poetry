# The Stillness
```
Freeways purr across the city
A dishwasher pulses in the kitchen
The chrome desklamp stutters through the darkness
This moment freezes in the stillness.

Wind combs through the birch leaves
A koi fish wiggles within the pond
The rabbit, perked, sees through me
This moment freezes in the stillness.

Lighning trips across the sky
A woman scrambles toward her car
The thunder shatters through society's walls
This moment freezes in the stillness.
