# Move On

```
I want you to see the real me --
the me I hold close,
and the one I put forward.

Then, I want you to move on.
I want you to be able to feel
  Nothing
    Sometimes
      Just for a while
and then sonder.

Let the wind comb your hair,
and silt your lashes with pollen,
and sieve away the anger and pain

I want you to feel the peace I do
Love, sure. But peace first

I want you to see the world the way that I do;
treating people with love because that's what is in your heart.
I want you to stop treating people with fear.
Stop assuming you are always right.
Stop assuming everyone else is right.
Stop fearing God, and Heaven, and Hell.
It's pointless to worry about things you can't control.

Just be.

Do not fear for us. 
Let us go, and you will be free,
Please, Mom.
