# The Dragon

```
The dragon sleeps with the stones.
It is a misunderstood mass of potential
energy.
Like a stone tower destined to topple
but lazily lounging instead.
We fear it because we do not understand death.
That is not power.
It is an exploitation
of ignorance.

The dragon is tired.
Thus, it sleeps.
