# I Will Carry You With Me

```
I will carry you with me.
Because we did not talk as much as I hoped.
You never told me why you stopped galavanting.

I will carry you.
Because this life is hollow without a sense of legacy.
We do things in hopes correct
our damaged world.

You corrected some of the damage in me
so
I will carry you.

As I journey through life's many intricacies,
I will help them shape you as they shape me.
Because I carry you in my heart,
we will be shaped together.
We will correct our world together.
We will love together,
as one Great entity.
