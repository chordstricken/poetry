# Distractions

The rumbling of the world spills secrets to
my ears and turns thoughts
into other thoughts
into other thoughts
into other things which are not always
what I was originally doing.
My life is suddenly a string of decisions made
in the moment; like when I wander around 
the kitchen in the morning, trying
to remember
how to 
make 
breakfast.
My attention, my discipline--it is a muscle.
It can be taut
It can be relaxed
It can be strengthened.
When I am strong, I will stare
my answers in the face;
chin held up, indignant of everything pressing down on me.
Self-doubt will melt away
a string at a time.
