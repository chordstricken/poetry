# The Fire

```
A dragon breathes inside my woes --
stewing; seething; creeping close.
Where suffering brews, my heartfire grows
to be released at dawning.
    -
Your sadness rips my world apart
shredded slowly, softly slain
Asunder felled your glowing art
and now it's happiness you feign.
    -
Stop this sing-song parade of
falseness
casting us into stone images
stone sculptures. Still and cold as anti-life.
Be free. Be who you never thought you could
be.
Become the light within
your shadow.
Cast into the flame;
The Fire.
