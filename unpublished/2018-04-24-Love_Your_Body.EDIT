# Love, Your Body

```
Love, you do this dance with yourself
making light of every intimate approach.
Love, you make silly noises when you
tease yourself at me.
Why do you do this?

Love, you trigger exasperations
sighing, clawing, smoking, drinking
when I talk of your body.
Why do you do this?

I am serious about my love
for your body.

#EDIT: lighten? more inspiration, affection
```
