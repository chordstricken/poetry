# The Wind

```
The wind carries our words through the air,
sometimes cheerily whisking them away.
But where could they float to?
Perhaps dispersed to whispers on the bay.
A change in pressure, a shift in particles;
thought turned physical through vibration;
simple components create these articles
which in turn we trust to steady our nation.
Words are wind if nobody hears them
but they can still be molded
and distorted in flight
The wind, however, will always just be
wind.
```
