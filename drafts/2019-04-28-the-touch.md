# The Touch

```
There was a moment, laying flat in the night
of the wild
my back curving along the earth
while the cool night drifts from
my eyebrows to the soles of my feet.
There was a moment when time stopped being
a forward moving thing; when time became
nothing but a silly joke.

I began to feel the earth's touch.
```
