# What Is The Dragon To You?

```
What is the Dragon to you?
To me?
Not a symbol of satan
    (Henry VIII would be remiss)

And what would that say about me, anyway?

Words and forms fall differently
on every ear, but
I can see you
Hear you
Understand you better
by what you feel when
faced with the word
Dragon.
```
