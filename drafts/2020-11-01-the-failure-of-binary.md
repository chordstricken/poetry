# The Failure of Binary

```
We are not binary beings
yet we pretend to be. try
to be
because life feels simpler when reduced
to decisions;
live or die
kill or save
black or white.
you might claim an AI profile is
not binary with its infinitesimal thetas,
but you cannot excuse its effect on the United States in 2020.
Democrat, or Republican.
Where both sides are so far removed
we are no longer neighbors.
And if we're not neighbors, what
are we?
```
