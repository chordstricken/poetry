# The Birth

```
It was slow.
You want to believe the birth of the world
happened in an observable moment.
That is natural, but unrealistic.
Consider the rock chisled by wind
then
consider the planet molded by gravity.

There was no flash of light or majestic
show of creation.
Only dull, creeping rocks
pressing awkwardly on one another.
```
