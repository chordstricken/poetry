    thought: this was an incredibly hot and difficult summer. I felt free and relaxed in this pool, but I wasn't in nature. I was in a cage; hotel, pool, lawn -- all human-made things which mimic nature.

# Cool Palm Springs Pool

```
A single jet stream echos
across the warm turquoise pool.
Another human creation pushing us away
from nature.

Two doves linger casually on a power line.
Embracing what I seemingly struggle to.
```
