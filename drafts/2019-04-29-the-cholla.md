    Good to be guarded? maybe elaborate on difference between defense mechanisms of cholla vs human
    "Hook" might need re-work

# The Cholla

```
Bernard has a prickly nature
Jumping at any opportunity to pierce
the soft defenses of those less guarded.
A rough, challenging history has formed this behavior
but we can yet admire Bernard
in a natural habitat.
If we are strong in our definitions of self,
we cannot truly be harmed
by a prickly disposition.
```
