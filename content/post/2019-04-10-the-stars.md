# The Stars

```
Astral Entity
richochets luminescence
world to world to world

    --

Wave, sometimes, photon;
dancing through this glass of mine,
stumping human minds.

    --

Gasseous, glowing, pure
slowly glowing through the void
rest not, red giant.

    --

Casting, at long last
simple, ghost-like reflections.
My eyes: star catchers
```
