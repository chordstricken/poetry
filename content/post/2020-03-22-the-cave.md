# The Cave

```
I do not fear the darkness of the cave.
I do not fear its echoing walls.
Whispering falls?
Glistening halls.
Sprawled through earth's metals, 
the gentle trickling of 
the power of time 
inspires me.
I think of the 
patience; the 
sureness of the 
water as it erodes the 
tunnels; 
moments in millenia.
I leave my troubles on the surface
at the mouth, and find my buried peace.
I do not fear the darkness of the cave.
It is simply the absence of photons.
Besides, you have four other senses to
observe with.
