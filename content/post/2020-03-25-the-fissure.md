# The Fissure

```
There is a tear in the land
over that mountain.
The earth which sings with fruit and bees
has been shredded.
Like a cradle carved from birch
cast into a chasm and smashed.
The land is now gone.
Birds fly in into the fresh abyss.
Heat radiates from the bosom of the planet.
Desert mice never emerged from their homes.
It happened with arrogance and neglect.
Superiority has led to inferiority.
There is a tear in the land,
and it goes far deeper than the earth.
```
