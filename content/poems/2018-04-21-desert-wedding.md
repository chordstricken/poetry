# Desert Wedding

```
I used to think the Sonoran drab.
Monotonous.

It is easy to scoff at beauty
when it is hammered into you
at a young age.

We are intricately trained creatures,
and sometimes we train ourselves into
a circle of repetition.
Like a roomba caught in a hallway.

Sometimes we just need to trip or twirl 
awkwardly
to get where we need to go.

The sonoran doesn't give a shit about my existentialism.
To it, I am a lilac trapped in sand.
