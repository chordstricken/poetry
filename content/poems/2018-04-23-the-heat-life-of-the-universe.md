# The Heat-Life of the Universe

```
A universe is contained within my physical body.
My electrons, stars within a strangely
but deeply fathomable void
of empty space. And these stars
dance within each other in the fiesta of light
The heat-life of the universe.
Do not feel alone, my friend.
Do not feel beaten, my friend.
Do not feel worthless, my friend.
Because we are all the Great Tortoises
of life
carrying songs into the unknown
```
