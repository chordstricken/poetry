# The Philodendron

```
The 
    philodendron 
                creeps 
                    across 
                       the wall
                twirling its 
        reach, grasping
     grasping 
    like 
        a desperate
                lover. And 
                   individuality 
                  is lost,
              folded
    gently into 
something
new
```
