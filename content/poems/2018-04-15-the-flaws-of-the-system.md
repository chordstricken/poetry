# The Flaws of the System

```
Anger is a flood breaching the hull.
It storms into your core and tries
to ruin every piece of your engine which
you have spent so much time building.
A compromise in a secure system...

That's not entirely true.

If the system was secure, how did this
breach, this flood of anger, find its way in?
We must assume it is instead a highlight
of our flaws.
The flaws of the system.
```
