# Rules for What's Good
```
A woman tazed her son for refusing church.
This happened.
I wonder, how did she justify this?
Is there logic? What is this logic based on?
How do we know whether she is mentally ill?
How do we quantify her illness?

How is her son? Will he be a normal member of society?
Will he now hurt other people in order to express his turmoil?
What is "normal?" How do we quantify that?

I am reminded that even the strictest rules
can still be mere guidelines
in the right mind.
```
